											<a href="#" class="active">Why did you make this website?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: block;">
											I created and deployed this website on a private <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> server so that I could learn more about web app design and back-end development.</p>

	   <p> In the future I will use this website as a nesting ground for web-based computer vision and NLP models. Though I don't expect it to be anything more than a portfolio site, I strongly suspect that these skills will be crucial to technological development in the years to come.</p>

											<a href="#">How long have you been practicing machine learning?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
										<p>I discovered machine learning at the beginning of 2018 after graduating from Baylor University. Since then, I have immersed myself in data science communities on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and across the web.</p>

										<p>I have rich experience in building machine learning solutions for NLP tasks. I have built models to assist in sentiment analysis, demographic clustering, and topic modelling.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>
											<a href="#">Do you have any experience working with databases?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
										<p>I have hosted and deployed my own MySQL database with this website. I have a intermediate knowledge of SQL queries, and have had experience working with AWS and GCP database servers through SSH.</p>
										<p>By renting servers from DigitalOcean, GCP, and AWS I have been able to develop my own back end production environment. I believe that data scientists who can own every step of the ML lifecycle will be invaluable in the coming years..</p>

										<dt>
											<a href="#">Why are you interested in NLP / machine learning?</a>
										</dt>
										<dd style="display: none;">
											<p>I am curious by nature. Machine learning and natural language processing are both excellent tools to understand the world better. </p>
										<p>Despite the hype over integrating AI into existing technologies, the implementation of machine learning (especially NLP) is still in its infancy. This field is the wildwest, and I want to work with the pioneers and innovators that create new and amazing things.</p>

									<dt>
										<a href="#"> What kind of work do you see yourself doing? </a>
									</dt>
									<dd style="display: none;">
									<p>I am interested in building modular machine learning applications that can communicate with existing production systems.</p><p> Position titles that do this work are not well defined. I describe my perfect future position to be a mix of data science, machine learning engineering, and devops. Essentially a machine learning specialist with the skills to deploy a model to production.</p>
